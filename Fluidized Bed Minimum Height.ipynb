In the second mode, the kinetics are lightning fast, and our particles quickly get saturated. Thus we either *build a higher column* (note - wider columns don't help as our superficial velocity is fixed) or we *recycle particles quicker*, or some combination of the two.\n",

We want to find a column height where the gas contact time is sufficiently long, but we'll also need to have at least *some* noticeable saturation of particles (with associated drop in reaction kinetics, leading, of course, to a higher column). Ultimately, the balance will be between minimizing column height and minimizing particle recirculation rate. Column height costs money in capital costs and pressure drop; particle recirculation rate costs money in capital cost and regeneration energy. We'll try to find a happy balance.\n",
